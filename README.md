# WeatherApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## APIXU

APIXU provides global weather data to users via their API. Using APIXU, a user can retrieve the latest weather as well as future weather forecasts for any location in the world. Sign up for a free APIXU account and obtain a free API key [here](https://weatherstack.com/).
If you log in to APIXU, youâ€™ll come to the dashboard, where you will see your key, and below that, links to the API URL with your key already pre-filled for both the Current Weather and Forecast Weather. Copy the HTTPS link for the Current Weather details and replace the text "YOUR_API_KEY" in the URL with your API key. Replace the location given in the URL (paris) with "location".
